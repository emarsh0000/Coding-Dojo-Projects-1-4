									<span class = "blue">Assignment Statement Considered Harmfull</span>. Pervasive mutable state male programs more difficult to deal with. While this is old news, most programmers don't know or don't care. It's a pitty, because 
									<a href = "www.google.com">simple remedies</a> exist.
								</li>
								<li style = "margin-bottom: 20px;">
									<span class = "blue">Defining Syntactic Sugar</span>. I sometimes hear arguments about what is or is not syntactic sugar. This is an attempt at defining it.
								</li>
								<li style = "margin-bottom: 20px;">
									<span class = "blue">Class-based Programming as Syntactic Sugar</span>. Most os the time, "Object Oriented" actually mean classes. Classes are nothing more than syntactic sugar, at least in statically typed languages such as Java and C++. Sugar is not useless, but seeing past it helps up understand classes better.
								</li>
								<li style = "margin-bottom: 20px;">
									<a href = "www.google.com">Taboo "OO"</a>.The term, "OO" is so overloaded that we should stop using it. Better substitutes are "classes" and "prototypes".
								</li>
								<li style = "margin-bottom: 20px;">
									<span class = "blue">How Class based Programming Sucks</span>. Classes are vastly sub-optimal. Functionnal programming is far better.
